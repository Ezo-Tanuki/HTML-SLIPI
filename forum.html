                            Hi guys so lately I have been sleeping late because of the project I'm doing, and that makes
                            me sleepy during the day even though i've drink my coffee in the morning.
                            Does anyone have any tips on how to sleep better with less sleeping hour than normal?
                        </p>

                            Hello everyone so I have been gaining a lot of weight recently
                            since There are a lot of things in my mind and I have been eating a lot as a coping mechanism
                            to reduce stress. And I'm searching a good way to reduce my weight without doing much and
                            I've heard that starving yourself for weight loss is a good thing to do. I don't think this is correct However
                            is that really the case?

                            Lately when I'm using my airpods, there are a lot of earwax left in my ears, I try cleaning in from the outside

                            reduce how much we have and what is the
                            healthiest way to clean your ears?

                            I'm a heavy smoker for the last 10 years and recently I've picked up e-cigarettes as I've seen
                            e-cigarettes uses are increasing by a lot lately since it's seen by a lot of people as a
                            healthy alternative to cigarettes. People also think that e-cigarettes doesn't have any risk unlike normal cigarettes.
                            However, is this really true?
